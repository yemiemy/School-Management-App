# A school management web application.

This project provides a platform for a school's admin to manage the admission and registration of students as well as the creation of courses and registration of students' parents. All of the school's data is appropriately saved and easy to access on the database. The application makes school management seamless. 

## Getting Started

#### Account Creation
Admin creates an account. This gives the admin access to the school's management dashboard.

#### Course registration or creation
Admin is now logged in and can start administratorial duties. First, admin creates courses (Subjects) for the classes in the school.

#### Register Students
Admin can then proceed to admit students into the school by filling the admission form. This will automatically save the student's dashboard on the database. All the students data can also be accessed. 
Admin has the clearance to edit student's details in future or in case ther was an error during registration.

#### Register Parents
Admin can now proceed to register students' parents. The registration will involve getting basic data about the parent.
A parent can have more than one ward (student) in the school. Admin will have to attach the students' name to their parent during the registeration of the parent.
